# App settings

The app settings provide access to all data values (either percentage or range) and visualizations (currently, only gauge). Each setting includes a **Last updated** property, which can be useful for debugging or cleaning up outdated settings that are no longer in use.

For gauge visualization settings, you can manage configurations directly from this screen. This includes adding new configurations and updating existing ones, such as adjusting colors and their respective offsets, to fine-tune how your gauges appear. These visualizations can also be configured via DataVista flow action cards.
